# myFlix API

### Project Description: 
The objective of this projest was to build a server-side component of a web applications meant to user to interact with movies. Each user will be able to review a listing of movies and be able to add them to their favorites list. Movies have different pieces of information that the user can look at such as director, genre, and summary. A user can also create, update, and delete a profile. 

### Technologies Used: 
Express | Node.js | MongoDB | 


### How to start up this project?


### API Used:
I built my own API in this project through EXPRESS and Node.js. API is hosted in Heroku.

### Learning Moments: 


### What would I do differently? 
A helpful contribution to this API would have been to have an endpoint for a user's favorite movies. An endpoint like this would allow for quicker load times instead of the current solution. Right now all the movies are loading from the database and filtering out the ones that are not the user's favorite list. Depending on how big the application may get, this could prevent a lag in waiting for all the movies to load. This allows for the application to be more scalable with a bigger database.
